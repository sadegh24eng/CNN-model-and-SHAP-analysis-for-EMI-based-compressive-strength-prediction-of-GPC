GPC_EMI_CNN_SHAP

This repository contains all scripts, Jupyter Notebooks, and example data related to the study:

“Non-destructive compressive strength prediction of geopolymer concrete using CNN and SHAP explainability of EMI signatures” submitted to Composites Part B: Engineering.

Contents:

Notebook.ipynb — Complete workflow: data preprocessing, CNN model definition, training, evaluation, and SHAP analysis of frequency-domain EMI data.

requirements.txt — Python packages and versions required to run the notebook.

data/ — Example EMI datasets (small, for demonstration purposes).


Purpose:
The repository enables full reproducibility of the results presented in the manuscript, including:

CNN-based regression modeling of compressive strength from EMI frequency signatures.

Feature importance analysis using SHAP to interpret influential frequency bands (notably 400–500 kHz).

Generation of figures such as SHAP beeswarm and summary plots.

Usage Instructions:
Download the data provided through the repective DOI attached in the manuscript then create the data as a text file (.txt) using the demo data.
